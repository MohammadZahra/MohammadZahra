## Hi there 👋

I'm Mohammad, based in Germany. I began my programming journey at the end of 2019 while studying at [htwsaar](https://www.htwsaar.de/).  
I have a passion for working at my desk, continuously learning new programming skills, and diving into design.

With a strong background in UI/UX, I've been channeling this experience into my software development journey, focusing on both front-end and back-end development.
